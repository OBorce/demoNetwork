Sample demo social network demonstrating, searching, adding, deleting and updating users and posts,
as a OAuth2 Resource server.

== Getting an access token

In order to use the resource server we need to get an access token through:
include::{snippets}/getToken/curl-request.adoc[]
For which we need an already registered application with its client id and secret,
and an authenticated user's credentials.
The token can later be used to access information of the users and posts on the network.

== User api

The User api consists of the flowing routes:

Getting an existing user by ID:
include::{snippets}/getUser/http-request.adoc[]

Which will return a response if the user is found like:
include::{snippets}/getUser/http-response.adoc[]

Creating a new user is done with a request like
include::{snippets}/createUser/http-request.adoc[]

Also updating an existing user is done with a request like
include::{snippets}/updateUser/http-request.adoc[]

All operation of getting, creating and updating an user return a response of the form:
include::{snippets}/getUser/http-response.adoc[]
